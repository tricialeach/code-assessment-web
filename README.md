## Notes

- This is my first time using React or Redux. I spent most of the first part of the week familarizing myself with the codebase, and learning online. Instead of pretending that I have something earth-shattering to share about React or Redux after a week, I'm going to give you some insight into my process of learning something new.
- I look for short overview tutorials or articles first, and then if I have time, I'll dig into something longer. I also like to learn by creating new Git branches and adjusting/breaking things until I understand them.
- The React/Redux sites have great documentation. The [Three Fundamental Principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles) and [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) were a great start.
- The first thing I did with the codebase was take note of the directories (actions, constants, reducers, components). This gave me a place to start with my learning.
- I also took note of what I did know (ES6, React is component based, that Redux store manages state for the entire app), and what what conventions were being used so I could match it as much as possible.
- I took care of the cart enhancements first. After I got an action, reducer, action type hooked up and somewhat working, I inspected the actions or errors logged to console, previous state vs next state until I got the feature fully working. I also installed the React and Redux dev tools so I could utilize those.
- In retrospect it may have been easier to fetch the new product data first so I didn't have to fix bugs related to that change, but having to do that did give me some extra practice.

## Wrap up
- Things I would do if I have more time:
  - Fix or add to prop-types validation. I tried to do that when I noticed it, but I know it needs more.
  - More components.
  - Get rid of some container divs. I had trouble getting React.Fragment to work, and needed to move on, so I ended up with more divs than I usually do.
  - More finessing cart responsiveness.
  - Try CSS modules. I knew I would not have enough time to learn a new CSS method, so I made the choice to spend more time studying React/Redux and just import my CSS. I can see where modules would be helpful, particularly with some tricky spots where the Product component is shared between cart/product page.
- I'm very happy I was able to take care of the cart enhancements and fetching the product data. I also added a product counter to the cart link in the header. Overall, a successful experience personally, and while I have a lot more to learn about React and Redux, this was a great start.

Thanks so much for your time reviewing this! ðŸ‘‹
